Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu), USA. In Summer 2020, I was a system engineering intern at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com). I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Communications Engineering from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), Iran, in 2012 and 2014, respectively. My research interests are UAV communications, channel modeling, stochastic geometry, and wireless communications.
