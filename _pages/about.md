Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/) at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/) under supervision of [Dr. Fatemeh Afghah](https://fafghah.people.clemson.edu/). I was a research assistant in the [College of Engineering and Applied Science](https://eas.uccs.edu/ece) at [University of Colorado Colorado Springs](https://www.uccs.edu/) from Jan. 2021 to Aug 2022. I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) and the [Iran university of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en), respectively.
